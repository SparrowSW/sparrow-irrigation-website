          We are Sparrow, an Egyptian company dedicated to solving a simple problem: 
          irrigation controllers that can't handle our local climate. We build simple, 
          durable, and reliable controllers for residential and professional gardens, 
          engineered to thrive in Egypt's unique conditions.
